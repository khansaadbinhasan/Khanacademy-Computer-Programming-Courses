        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cut 1 of the serrano peppers into halves lengthwise, retaining the seeds. Place the pepper in a large saucepan and add the water, vinegar, sugar, beets, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool completely.
        Add the eggs to the beet liquid and refrigerate for at least 6 hours. Remove the eggs from the liquid and let them dry completely.
        Cut the eggs into halves lengthwise and remove the yolks. Place the yolks in a medium bowl and place the whites on a large plate. Add the mayonnaise, olive oil, mustard, and Sriracha to the yolks. Mix and mash to combine thoroughly. Fill the whites with the yolk mixture. Slice the remaining serrano pepper into rounds. Top each egg with a slice of serrano and a sprinkle of curry powder, if desired.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large rondeau or skillet with straight sides over high heat until smoking.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Season the ground meats with salt, pepper, and ground cloves. Add the pork, veal, and lamb, and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up large chunks of meat until cooked through, about 15 minutes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once meats are caramelized, add the pureed chicken livers and chopped sage, basil, chili flakes and parsley and cook, stirring constantly, until just cooked through, about 2-4 minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Add onion, celery, and carrots and cook, stirring frequently. Now deglaze with the wine to the meats and bring to a boil over high heat. Allow to reduce until almost gone, about 15 minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Add chicken stock, veal stock, bay leaf, and tomatoes. Bring pot to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors are married and sauce is reduced to a thick, spoon-coating consistency, about 2 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Finish by adding some butter and heavy cream. Bring to a boil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow the sauce to cool, then refrigerate at least overnight.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong>For serving, heat amount needed in sauté pan and add some heavy cream, chicken stock and black pepper. Fold in basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and parsley and serve with desired pasta. Garnish with torn basil leaves and Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
