            <h1>Getting Started with <span class="important">Typing</span></h1>


            <p>When I started my journey as a programmer. I had this problem that i was unable to type fast. And because of that I lost a lot of precious time. So one day I decided that I will become a very good typist. I was always facinated by all the people typing so fast and hence my journey began.</p>

            <p>I remembered from my childhood a software called <strong>typing master</strong>. It was an awesome piece of software and i downloaded it and found it to be very helpful. I spent half an hour a day eating through the practice sessions. And after a month I guess i completed all the tutorials and then began the paid version which i didnt took. Also my typing was good enough for me at that point and i had other concerns like programming to think of. So i stopped typing practice. Then After about six months I got my own laptop and decided that I am going to improve my typing.</p>

            <p>At that point i came across this website called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr </a>and instantly fell in love with it. I spent next three months and about 30 hrs on that website to become a better typist. Starting off my typing speed was only 25wpm but with time it increased and by the time i left my top speed was touching 75 wpm and average speed well over 60wpm. The initial goal i set was 50wpm So I was very much satisfied with the result. I would highly recommend both typing-master and keybr if you want to learn typing. And after you are done with them you can use <a target="_blank" href="http://play.typeracer.com/">typeracer</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english">ten-fast-fingers.</a></p>

            <p>I personally like typeracer alot because it gives you a platform to show to others how good your typing is and by going into a competition you can be certain of your position around the world. Also it gives you a feeling of pride. To this day typing remains the only thing i am seriously proud of. So Heres the order of softwares/websites I would recommend to learn typing:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Typing Master</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="http://play.typeracer.com/">Type-racer</a></li>
            </ol>

        <div id = "programming">

            <h1>Getting Started with <span class="important">Programming</span></h1>

            <p>I started programming in september 2016 and I would admit that it was very difficult at first. Even small programs for swapping two numbers which seem like everyday thing now were a huge drain on the brain. It was probably because I had no previous background in programming and because it seemed so difficult and unrewarding at first It repelled me. But i kept trying and trying without succeeding. I would copy code from the worksheets we got, I copied code from websites. Then I started typing that code myself, and it was a bit of an improvement and I started seeing different things in the code. Then i started tinkering with that code and kept doing that for a long time. I downloaded apps for programming(They were not helpful at all).</p>

            <p>After that many people recommended <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">newboston</a> and i found it quite helpful. It helped me get past half the semester. But the problem with it was that it was very fast and i was unable to grab many of the concepts Hence i needed something else. I searched online and found that there was a book called 'Let us C by yashwant kanetkar'. I already had that book so I started learning from it. Since now I already had some background in C programming I was able to learn very easily in the beginning and I got extreme pleasure from that. This motivated me read the book more and more and I did just that when after doing half the book I encountered let's say some topics beginners should avoid( I will come back to that later ).</p>

            <p>I still had my exams for the end term and the whole book was part of the course and most of my concept weren't so clear.Then a friend suggested me these <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ersPsTyYt2Q-SqZxTA1D-melSfqBRMW">lectures</a>(Note: These are in Hindi).They were of great help and all my concepts were now clear and after that semester I also completed 'Let Us C'. And a year later I feel passionate as well as confident about C programming.</p>  

            <p>Programming is easy but learning programming is hard. In my opinion you should start learning programming with C/C++ because you have to do everything from the scratch and you dont get that much inbuilt methods. Even if you do find those methods, I would suggest you avoid them as much as you can so that you can understand whats going under the hood. C is a wonderful language and most languages are either based on or written in C/C++. If you know the syntax of C/C++ then it should be easy for you to learn any other language in no time. Also C/C++ are very useful in learning about the inner workings of the computer and it is also used in embedded systems and machines that have limited computational power.</p>

            <p>Even though i suggest learning C as a beginner I wouldnt still suggest that any beginner should go near pointers in C/C++. This concept is more or less unique in C/C++ It deals with manipulating the storage areas directly in memory Hence it can be tough to get your head around it(memory is a weird place!!!). I would suggest you learn all the other things and leave pointers and file handling for later when you have more knowledge of programming and you start liking it seriously. In the meantime keep practicing programming for atleast three months doing competitive programming is a very good way to practice programming. And once you are confident enough start learning about pointers and stuff.</p>

        <div id = "linux" >
            <h1>Getting Started with <span class="important">Linux</span></h1>
    
            <p>While learning programming I heard a lot of bad things about windows. Many of my friends said that if you want to become a real programmer abandon windows because it will take you nowhere. I read many articles suggesting to switch away from windows as soon as possible. At that time i didn't understand a thing about operating systems. But since Everyone was saying those things about windows I was startled but curious so I decided to give linux a try. So when I had my own laptop i dual booted that with ubuntu.</p>

            <p>Initially it wasn't that interesting and most of the time I would go back to using windows and within the first three months i rarely used it except for programming purposes but as time went by windows started to disappoint me more and more. The main problem was of updates. Since I had only limited amount of mobile data i wanted to save it for educational purposes instead of wasting it on some stupid updates of which i wasnt even aware of. I tried to stop them but there was no choice. Also my windows was hanging alot and the computer was getting slower and slower everyday. Till then I was using windows only for gaming purposes so one day I decided to do away with windows and uninstalled it. Its been a year now and there is not a single thing that ubuntu cant do that windows can except maybe gaming and other graphics stuff.</p>

            <p>Now using linux operating system has its own sets of challenges because most of us were born and raised using windows. So its difficult for us to get used to any other user-interface. But Ubuntu makes it very easy. I have Ubuntu 16.04 for almost a year now and I dont find any problem interacting with it. Its alot faster than windows and needs less resources. Even very old computers can use Ubuntu. My decision to use Ubuntu was also an ethical one. I was tired of windows interfering with everything I felt that i was being controlled and the notion that they were selling my information to others really made me angry. Then i read about the open source movement and free softwares. And linux was at the head of that. So i had to use linux any way.</p>

            <p>Now Linux is an open source operating system developed by Linus Torvalds. This means that all its source code is available free of cost and you can alter it as you please. This idea is very empowering because since all source code is available you can check for backdoors and remove them if there are any. Its also free of cost and puts an end to paid closed source softwares which dont even respect your privacy. Linux Torvalds only developed the 'Linux Kernel' which is basically the part that interacts with the hardware. But normal users dont use kernel directly because you need to know a great deal about computers before interacting with kernels so instead there are layer over the kernel to help users interact in an easier way. After all the layers there are GUI-graphical user interface that most user use in windows i.e, by using mouse and seeing icons we interact with them and then there is CLI-command line interface which is faster than GUI easier to navigate and takes less time to perform any action and also needs less resources but it is very hard to learn. Windows users interact with GUI mode all their life without understanding whats going on under the hood. But linux is different</p>

            <p>As mentioned above The user needs a user-interface to interact with the kernel, These are provided by many companies and all the different user-interfaces are called distributions or distros. One of the most popular distro of linux is ubuntu. Because it provides a good GUI experience almost similart to windows so it is easy to make a transition to linux from windows. Also Ubuntu forums are very vibrant and you can get answer to any question within minutes.But if you want to use linux you must use CLI because thats what makes linux stand apart. There is a program called terminal in ubuntu that helps us in this. <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1oEimMl6oZp96HvQ8BAyp22csOSODsCic"> Terminal seems boring and intimidating at first but with enough practice it becomes better and better.</p>

            <p>The main benefit of using terminal is that you can download any software just by using a single command. Instead of going to the softwares website donwloading it, unzipping it , installing it , clicking OK a dozen time you can just type `sudo apt-get install <span>software-name</span>` <br> The above command works in most cases and saves us from a ton of work we will have to do in windows. If you want to install some other software you can go to its website and simply copy paste a bunch of commands to install it. Also since linux is open-source if you find any problem with any of the functioning you can report it and it will be fixed in less than a week. If you know enough programming you can customize it the way you want. This is a very desirable property because different industries have different needs for computers. For example weather forecasting computers may need to run only weather related softwares so they can customize linux to suit their needs and so can Internet servers. But with windows you can not do this without paying big bucks to company to do that for you or downloading costly softwares.</p>

            <p>Coming back to terminal, Its very hard in the beginning to learn the commands because there are so many of them I faced the same problem but then i came across these awesome tutorials <a target="_blank" type="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLckPQEKYlbxebubMWdjcGR7K_ukm35ZjN"></a> I did only the first five or so tutorials but they were quite helpful in getting started. I then started using them and finding more commands on stack-overflow as and when needed soon i felt like a wizard using the terminal. I still did some more courses though <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGCkg2uj3PxUWhMDuTw3VKjM">newboston linux tutorials</a> and then this <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">codeacademy linux tutorials</a>. These courses are more than enough to give you a good experience with command line. While doing this I kept learning various keyboard shortcuts. All this helped me learning how to use linux and now i am pretty comfortable in using ubuntu and command line.</p>

        </div>


        <div id = "git">
            <h1>Getting Started with <span class="important">Git , Shell Scripting , Sublime , Vim</span></h1>

            <p>Vim is a text-editor that means you can edit text files in it. Vim is one of the oldest text-editors but is still very popular and most seasoned programmers prefer it over other alternatives like sublime , atom , notepad etc. One of the main reason for that it is command line based so you can do all your work in terminal without going through the trouble of switching between tabs all the time, Also it is very powerful because you can do all your work without having to touch mouse, this gives you immense speed improvement. You dont have to move your hand anywhere except on the keyboard. But like all other linux things it has a steep learning curve, When i started learning vim i almost gave up because i liked sublime more as it has a nice look and feel and i knew all the shortcuts in it. Its autocompletion was awesome and suggestions were good too. But the thing i liked the most was the keyboard shortcuts. There were many of them but they were all very useful. Nonetheless i continued learning vim because it seemed like a good thing to invest time on. I learned from vim-tutor which are official tutorials for learning vim. I guess they are good enough if you want to learn vim fast. You can complete the whole tutorials in about an hour and then you need to practice alot to get better grip on vim. The main problem i faced and still facing is the autocompletion, there are many plugins for that like you-complete-me but i am unable to install them and the reason is beyond my reach. But i still use vim ocassionally and its very satisfyings.</p>

            <p>Git is a version control system. It is used when we are doing programming or working on a software. While building softwares we keep changing our code maybe because we are fixing some bug or tweaking with something, now this may result in catastrophic problems because you are continously changing things which may break the things that were otherwise working already, To avoid this we have version control systems, What they do is that they save the state of the system at some point in time which maybe specified by user while doing some changes like in git you need to execute a `commit` command to tell git to store the information of code at current state. This is very usefule because after saving you can make any number of changes you want and if they work fine, then its good else you can undo the changes and come back to square one. Git is also very useful when more than one person is working on a software which is the case usually because softwares are big and you need many people to work on them, Now they need to collaborate in some way that is through git, For example if you have been asked to develop some part of the code and you do that now you need to patch that up with the main code. So what you do is that you make a patch and commit it to the parent branch, Then your project manager can see that its working correctly or not, Then he/she can tell you to make some changes or accept your patch as is. This reduces the chance of any problem that may arise and even if you have any problem you can always go back.</p>

            <p>I wanted to learn git out of curiousity. And these tutorials were very useful in that: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKWClAD_iKpNC0bGHxGhcx">newboston</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git"></a> Learning git is more or less like learning about the command line, Its like an added feature of command line, So if you know command line and directory structure then it would be very easy for you to learn git.</p>

            <p>Shell scripting is used for automating the computer, you can make a shell script execute it and sit back to see what it does and enjoy the show, it is one of the coolest thing i found on linux and i instantly fell in love with it. Its basically a bunch of commands in a file with .sh extension Some people also call it a different language. I found these tutorials very useful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7B7FA4E693D8E790">Shell Scripting Tutorials</a></p>

        <div  id = "frontEnd">
            <h1>Getting Started with <span class="important">Front-end Web Developement</span></h1>

            <p>Front-end web developement means the user interface and user experience that is associated with different websites. Whenever we see a website the part that we interact with and see on the screen and various pop-ups and buttons and other things that we see on screen is called front end. Front-end web development is done with HTML,CSS and javascript. I started learning all these because i wanted to make a website, I learnt these things from many different sources which some may even called too many. Most of the time i was only doing courses instead of concentrating on my project. The best way to learn anything is to find a project and work on it. Doing many courses never really helps. The less courses you do and more you concentrate on projects the faster you learn and the more rewarding the experience. Its the opposite in my case, I kept learning but i was very shy while implementing it.</p>

            <p>I did the computer programming course on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/">khanacademy</a> and web development courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a> I also tried <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> and <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud304">udacity</a> I also thought for a while to buy some courses on udemy but was saved by my better sense of judgement. It was like an addiction, You can do as many of these courses as you want but you cant do anything useful unless you start doing something or yourself. Anyways I am currently doing khanacademy courses because they give you projects so you can learn faster.</p>

            <p>While learning front-end web dev I found all the above courses very useful but i would highly recommend khanacademy courses because you can make projects and have them evaluated for free. Front-end web development seems very easy but it isnt. Its only easy when you are working on small projects but as you go on working on bigger projects it gets more and more difficult, and you have to unlearn whatever you learnt. Also making your website responsive is a big deal nowadays and with so many ways to do that it is hard to choose one. I learnt HTML/CSS and javascript on khanacademy and codeacademy. And processing js on khanacademy Right now i am trying to learn DOM and jquery, I may soon learn bootstrap also. I would highly recommend khanacademy computer programming course and processing js is a bliss because you get to learn so much about computer graphics and you learn alot of maths and geometry in the process that it has no parallel.</p>
        </div>  

        
        <div id = "openSource">
            <h1>Getting Started with <span class="important">Open-source</span> projects</h1>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The following views are personal and I am an ignorant, lazy guy so please ignore them if they are wrong and sorry if you are offended in any way</p>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I first came across open-source when i was looking for projects.Then I learnt about these awesome softwares that were free to use , modify , distribute etc. These softwares made me feel empowered. They made me feel that i can be the master of my own destiny, That i dont have to put up with big , evil organizations violating my privacy in all possible way and selling my data to other companies. I felt like I was being used as a product So opensource softwares provided the path for me to be free and liberated , Hence I instantly fell in love with them.</p>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I decided whatever I make and help build will be open-source and I will start contributing to open-source organizations as soon as I can. So, I started learning programming. I learnt C then C++. But it wasnt enough so i started learning javascript then python. But still whenever i tried to contribute to open-source projects I was intimidated by sheer amount of code. Even though I came pretty close to contributing to osrf but there was too much math and physics involved so I had to quit. I saw the issues and couldn't understand what they were talking about. I got depressed then tried again then that cycle went on for about a year In the meantime I learnt a lot of things but never got to contribute to any open-source projects. I learnt about a lot of open-source organizations like mozilla and osrf and wanted to be a part of them. But the same problem occured again and again.</p>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I searched the internet for everything but to no avail. I found long boring articles which put me to sleep. And they all said the same thing-"Find a good project that interests you and start contributing". But here's the problem-"I can't understand whats going on with issues section". Do I have to go through the whole code?!!! or just a part of it. No one was explaining that. Even youtube gave up on me. At many places I found people saying that you should contribute to documentation, but Hey documentation is huge, How do I go through that, I guess there should be some tutorials on youtube and there should be some projects only to help beginners walkthrough the proces so that everyone can contribute and help build a free society.</p>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But After many failed attempts I found the organizations i wanted to contribute to and felt strongly about. These are- OSRF,Mozilla and stanford NLP. Mozilla is very intimidating for me because they have tons of webpages detailing how to contribute. They even have a site called bugzilla whose layout seems very intimidating. It got tons of code and documentation and I suppose as a beginner its not a good organization to contribut to. So I am going to stick with stanford NLP for now and keep you guys updated as to what happens.</p>
